## 1. Day of the Lord

---
<span class="hl2">(2:1)</span>
Blow the **trumpet** in Zion; <br/>
sound the **alarm** on my holy hill.

Let all who live in the land **tremble**, <br/>
for the **day of the Lord** is coming.

---
<span class="hl2">1</span>
It is **close** at hand — <br/>
<span class="hl2">2</span>
a day of **darkness** and gloom, <br/>
a day of **clouds** and blackness.

Like **dawn spreading** across the mountains <br/>
a large and mighty **army** comes, <br/>
such as never was in ancient times <br/>
nor ever will be in ages to come.

---
<span class="hl2">11</span>
The Lord **thunders** at the head of his army; <br/>
his forces are **beyond number**, <br/>
and mighty is the army <br/>
that **obeys** his command.

The **day of the Lord** is great; it is dreadful. <br/>
Who can **endure** it?

---
## Habakkuk 3:17 <small>(NIV) (p.1/2)</small>
Though the **fig tree** does not bud <br/>
and there are no **grapes** on the vines,

though the **olive crop** fails <br/>
and the **fields** produce no food,

though there are no **sheep** in the pen <br/>
and no **cattle** in the stalls,

---
## Habakkuk 3:18 <small>(NIV) (p.1/2)</small>
yet I will **rejoice in the Lord**, <br/>
I will be **joyful in God** my Savior.

## 2. God's Call

---
<span class="hl2">12</span>
“**Even now**,” declares the Lord,

“**return** to me with all your **heart**, <br/>
with fasting and **weeping** and mourning.

<span class="hl2">13</span>
Rend your **heart** and not your **garments**."

---
<span class="hl2">13</span>
**Return** to the Lord your God, <br/>
for he is **gracious** and **compassionate**,

**slow to anger** and **abounding in love**, <br/>
and he **relents** from sending calamity.

## 3. Our Response

---
<span class="hl2">15</span>
Blow the **trumpet** in Zion, <br/>
declare a holy **fast**, call a sacred **assembly**.

<span class="hl2">16</span>
**Gather** the people, **consecrate** the assembly

>>>
Rev stones, still refuse to repent

## 4. Promise of Restoration

---
<span class="hl2">26</span>
You will have **plenty** to eat, until you are **full**, <br/>
and you will **praise** the name <br/>
of the Lord your God, <br/>
who has worked **wonders** for you; <br/>
never again will my people be **shamed**.

<span class="hl2">27</span>
Then you will know that I am **in Israel**, <br/>
that I am the **Lord your God**, <br/>
and that there is **no other**; <br/>
never again will my people be **shamed**.

---
<span class="hl2">28</span>
And afterward, I will pour out <br/>
**my Spirit** on all people.

Your sons and daughters will **prophesy**, <br/>
your old men will dream **dreams**, <br/>
your young men will see **visions**.

---
<span class="hl2">30</span>
I will show **wonders** <br/>
in the heavens and on the earth, <br/>
**blood** and **fire** and billows of **smoke**.

<span class="hl2">31</span>
The sun will be turned to **darkness** <br/>
and the moon to **blood**

before the coming of the great <br/>
and dreadful **day of the Lord**.

---
<span class="hl2">32</span>
And everyone who calls <br/>
on the **name of the Lord** will be **saved**
