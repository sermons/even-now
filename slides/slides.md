a large and mighty **army** comes, <br/>
such as never was in ancient times <br/>
nor ever will be in ages to come.

---
<span class="ref">11</span>
The Lord **thunders** at the head of his army; <br/>
his forces are **beyond number**, <br/>

The **day of the Lord** is great; it is dreadful. <br/>
Who can **endure** it?

and no **cattle** in the stalls,

## Habakkuk 3:18 <span class="ref">(NIV) (p.1/2)</span>
yet I will **rejoice in the Lord**, <br/>
I will be **joyful in God** my Savior.
