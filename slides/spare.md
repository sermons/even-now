## Habakkuk 3:17 <span class="ref">(NIV) (p.1/2)</span>
Though the **fig tree** does not bud <br/>
and there are no **grapes** on the vines,

though the **olive crop** fails <br/>
and the **fields** produce no food,

though there are no **sheep** in the pen <br/>
and no **cattle** in the stalls,

## Habakkuk 3:18 <span class="ref">(NIV) (p.2/2)</span>
yet I will **rejoice in the Lord**, <br/>
I will be **joyful in God** my Savior.
